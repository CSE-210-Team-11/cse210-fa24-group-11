# Documentation Generator Selection

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a modern, efficient code quality solution for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that combines linting and formatting in one tool. While tool maturity is important, we prioritize performance, unified configuration, and modern development experience.

## Decision Drivers

* Ensure the tool supports the primary coding language
* Look for a tool that is easy to set up and configure
* Tools that integrate well with IDEs or version control systems make documentation updates easier and faster
* Ensure the tool is efficient in terms of CPU and memory usage
* Provides immediate feedback or supports live reloading
* Developer experience
* Look for tools that allow styling, layout, and content flexibility

## Considered Options

* [JSDoc] - A straightforward tool for generating structured JavaScript documentation.
* [Docco] - Creates simple, side-by-side code and comment documentation for easy reading.
* [Sphinx] - A powerful, customizable documentation tool for complex, multi-language projects.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "JSDoc", because it makes JavaScript documentation simple and works well with code editors.
