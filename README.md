# **Streek** ðŸŒ³  
*Let your progress take root and grow!*  

Once upon a time, Angry Atishay was stuck in a cycle of procrastination, trying to learn programming but never quite hitting his stride. Then he discovered **Streek**â€”an app that tracks his progress and turns every completed lesson into part of a growing tree. Now he's Calm Atishay, watching his "Streek Tree" thrive with every achievement.
